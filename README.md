## Executive Summary
TeamUp is a web app designed for sports fans. It connects players, helps them find games, and allows the organization of sports tournaments. With an easy-to-use interface, users can check game schedules, join or create teams, and sign up for tournaments. \
Overall, it’s a platform that builds a strong sports community, making it easy for everyone to play and enjoy sports together.

## Unique Freatures
The unique feature of our app is the ability to use the app to find and join casual sports matches. Our competitors, such as SportsEngine and ZogSports are only for sport tournaments. Our app allows the ability to create and join casual, non-competitive sport matches. Other competitors, like Plei, only focus on a single sport, Soccer. This does not cover casual matches for other sports. And websites like Meetup allow any type of meetup, not just sports. Our app focuses just on sports so it has a better experience for sports.

Another unique feature is the ability to review game locations and users. You can review game locations on aspects such as facility quality or nearby amenities. You can also review other users based on their skill level or attitude. Some of our competitors do offer the ability to give accolades to other users, but not to give a star rating and written review.

## Main Challenges

* **Time Management** \
We often missed our deadlines and finished tasks just before they were due. This happened because we didn’t manage our time well and weren't as productive as we could have been.

* **Project Complexity** /
Our website ended up being more complicated than planned. We decided to cover many sports, which made the project harder to manage compared to if we had focused on just one sport.

* **Story** /
When we were submitting Milestone 3, the auto-deployment of the app caused us a lot of trouble. We had difficulty finding the mistake. To solve this issue, we held a meeting to discuss recent changes to the code that might have caused the problem. We identified that the issue was related to Next.js but still couldn’t pinpoint the exact problem. As we were falling behind schedule, we reorganized tasks so that Areeb, the person in charge of solving this issue, could focus solely on it. We initially thought the problem was due to compatibility with AWS and spent $20 deploying on Vercel. However, after deploying on this new server provider, we encountered the same error. After carefully reviewing each file of our current code, we discovered that macOS doesn't consider capitalization in file imports, while the Ubuntu server does. This mismatch caused the code to break. We learned how to target bugs effectively and manage our time to solve them.
